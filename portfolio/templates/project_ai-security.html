                        This project aims to detect all backdoors embedded within AI models in the domain of Computer Vision. Backdoors refer to a pattern of pixels
                        deliberately embedded within an image that forces a model to classify the image as something else. This can be dangerous: image a stop sign 
                        being mis-classified as an "200km/h" by driverless vehicles due to a backdoor placed by a malicious agent. The project uses advanced techniques
                        such as neural attention distillation, mean absolute deviation for trigger reconstruction, noising, and robustness perturbation. We're quite
                        thrilled to be able to reconstruct the triggers and detect the backdoors embedded in subject models.
